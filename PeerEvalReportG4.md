# 💜 Peer Evaluation & Presentation Review for Group 4 (0619, by MK316)

+ Your group really set a high bar with your presentation! The integration of multimodal features into the grammar lesson was exceptionally executed, enriching both the listening and pronunciation components effectively. It’s fantastic to see how you used apps to transform a traditional grammar lesson into a dynamic learning experience that covers extensive skills.

+ Your choice to include a variety of apps was highly praised for keeping the lesson engaging and making learning enjoyable. Specifically, the pronunciation testing tool in App2 and the grammar checker were standout features that enhanced the interactive learning environment. Additionally, the use of QR codes to simplify access to these apps was a clever touch that made your presentation not only innovative but also accessible.

+ However, there were some areas noted for potential improvement. The cloze activity, for instance, seemed challenging for some peers, suggesting that adding hints or more scaffolding might make such activities more accessible. Also, focusing on fewer apps might help to deepen the learning experience rather than broaden it, ensuring that students are not overwhelmed and can concentrate on mastering the language skills being taught.

+ The sequencing of activities with audio files and pictures was a brilliant idea, enhancing the comprehension of listening texts. Yet, the links between activities could be strengthened. For example, practicing irregular past verb forms through text might better support the writing objectives than a listening cloze test.

+ Moreover, some feedback mentioned the necessity for more detailed instructions and possibly revising the listening cloze activities to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Incorporating more interactive and paired work, as suggested, could also help enhance student engagement and understanding, especially in complex tasks.

+ Overall, your work was commendable, and the feedback received is a testament to your group's hard work and creativity. Moving forward, focusing on refining these applications by addressing the feedback could make your future lessons even more successful. Keep up the great work, and thank you for your dedication to improving educational experiences through innovative teaching methods!

|1|It was great to use multimodal features in the app. Even though it was a grammar lesson, it covered listening and pronunciation extensively.|
|2|I loved that Ss could test their pronunciation with App2. The grammar checker was also really cool. I also loved the implementation of the QR code. Nice job!|
|3|앱에 다양한 활동들을 담아 그것을 큐알코드로 제공해 아이들이 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 한 것이 가장 인상적이었다.|
|4|All|
|5|Coding makes the teachers’ work easier and helps students learn efficiently.|
|6|Sequencing part provides audio file and picture for learners. I think that was a good idea.|
|7|Using their own apps to make the lesson more effective and dynamic|
|8|Diverse apps! They look engaging! Great ideas for making apps.|
|9|Easy to access and all activities were related to their goals!|
|10|Integration. 텍스트를 들으면서 발음도 확인해볼 수 있게 combine한 점|
|11|5개의 앱을 활용한 쓰기 수업을 발표를 준비하면서, 많은 영감을 받았습니다. 피드백을 즉각적으로 줄 수 없다는 점에서 EFL에서는 쓰기 지도가 특히 어렵습니다. 또한 학습자들의 어휘수준이 낮고, 인풋이 적은 환경에서 듣기 또한 지도하기가 어려웠습니다. 그러나 코딩을 활용하여 학습자 수준에 맞도록 인풋을 제공해주고, 학습자들이 스스로 코딩의 활용여부를 결정 (발음평가)함으로써 더 폭넓은 학습경험을 제공할 수 있음을 알았습니다. 또한 AI의 무한한 발전으로 곧 즉각적인 피드백을 제공해주는 교실이 찾아온다는 것을 느끼면서, 스스로 더 많이 공부하고 준비해야 됨을 깨달았습니다.|
|12|All the apps were very fancy and new! Especially that listening app was very impressive.|
|13|앱이 정말 디테일하고 좋았어요.|
|14|Accessibility and Presentation were "outstanding" in the presentation of Group 4. I liked that they tried to provide the QR codes and the URL for students so that they might choose the easier way to get access.|

## [3] Essay feedback 2: _What aspects should the presenting group have paid more attention to?_

|1|The cloze activity was a bit challenging. It would have been better with some hints or scaffolding. I'm not sure if grammar check without feedback is effective; maybe narrowing it down to checking past tense verbs and providing feedback together would be better.|
|2|It might be a good idea to have more modelling and implement more interactive work. This was addressed in your presentation but I think the Listening cloze activity was a little difficult to follow. The directions say the Ss will hear the word but it appears to be a blank beep sound? And in general it might be hard for the Ss to do alone. In the lesson plan, it only mentions possible pair work in the post-listening. It might be a good idea to make the cloze activity or other activities as pair work.|
|3|It's perfect!|
|4|We have to give more detailed instruction on application.|
|5|Nothing|
|6|Everything seemed fine|
|7|But the links among activities are kind of weak. For example, I think practicing irregular past verb forms in text is more helpful than listening cloze test to do writing at the end of the lesson.|
|8|Clear instructions or revision will be needed for the listening cloze activity. Other than that, it was a great presentation! Thank you for sharing your hard work!|
|9|They were doing so great!|
|10|학생들이 직접 텍스트를 보게 된다는 점이 Listening class로써 주의해야할 점이고 Grammar에 포인트를 잘 잡아 레슨플랜이 잘 짜여졌는데 상대적으로 listening text를 얼마나 잘 이해했는지 또는 이 지문을 가지고 이야기를 해보는 등 comprehension을 확인하는 과정도 있었으면 좋겠다.|
|11|"학습자들의 수업 접근성과 몰입을 가장 신경썼습니다."|
|12|They already have good apps. But it seems like they need to focus on details. Because there were some errors and some parts were hard to understand how to use it.|
|13|너무 많은 앱 보다 몇가지를 좀 더 자세하게 다루어주었어도 좋았을 것 같아요|
|14|The presentation of Group 4 was very easy to understand with clear instructions and the teacher's effort with enjoyable encouragement. Also, after the presentation, the members tried to answer the questions as best they could.|
